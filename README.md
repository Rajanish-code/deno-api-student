This project demonstrates how to build a simple Student API using Deno. It includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for student data.

Prerequisites


Deno installed (v1.34.0 or later)
Basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript


Getting Started
1. Install Deno
To install Deno, follow the official Deno installation guide.




For example, on Windows, use PowerShell:


bash
Copy code
iwr https://deno.land/install.ps1 -useb | iex
On macOS or Linux, use the following:




bash
Copy code
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
Verify the installation:

bash
Copy code
deno --version
2. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Rajanish-code/deno-api-student.git
Navigate into the project directory:





cd deno-api-student
3. Run the Student API
To start the server, use the following command:


deno run --allow-net --allow-read app.ts
This will allow Deno to access the network and read files as needed. The server will run on http://localhost:8000.





    
6. Permissions
Deno's permission model ensures that the API doesn't have access to anything it doesn't explicitly request. We use the following permissions:

--allow-net: Allows the API to listen to network requests.
--allow-read: Allows the API to read student data from files.




7. Further Reading

Step 5: Deploy the Project

1. Once the project is connected to Railway, it will automatically detect your Deno project.

2. Under "Deploy Settings", Railway will attempt to detect your command. If it doesnâ€™t, you can manually enter it:
3.bash 
4.write  deno run --allow-net --allow-read app.ts
5. Click "Deploy".
